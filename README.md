This python file contains python code that creates a new text file named input.txt and writes five lines of text in the text file.
Then the text is converted to upper case and the code also counts the number of words in the input.txt file. 
The results from these actions are then written in a output.txt file. 
Lastly, the code indicates that the output file has been created successfully.
